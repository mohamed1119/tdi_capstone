With the recent interest in electric cars and news stories about Tesla car sales, it is worth exploring at a deeper level how electric cars will affect the energy sector. One primary selling point for electric cars is that they provide cheaper fuel costs that can make up for the higher initial cost of the cars within 5 years. This capstone project aims to analyze transportation and energy data to determine what would happen if everyone in the United States switched to electric cars. In my initial analysis, I found that electric cars are more cost effective in terms of fuel costs if they themselves are more efficient. Given that traditional car manufacturers are aiming for higher miles per gallon goals and the historically low gas prices, when would be the breaking point given today's electric and gas prices? Even with current efficiency standards, driving a Tesla in Hawaii is only marginally better than driving a gas-powered car. I also found that the current generation of electricity in the US would need to increase by at least 50% in almost all states. Does the US have the infrastructure in place today to support electric cars on the grid? Finally, it is worth looking at the sources of electricity. Another selling point for electric cars is that they reduce dependence on non-renewable resources. However, many power plants still rely on natural gas or coal for generation. It would be interesting to look at how that translates to pollution in terms of electric cars.
